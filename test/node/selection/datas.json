Consequently, you are not entitled to upload content by which you pursue any commercial interests. \r\n\r\n7.1.4 If VIMN makes any content, including, without limitation, works of music, available to you for creating UGC, use of such content shall expressly be limited to the scope described and permitted in the offer. Any use and reproduction of content made available by VIMN beyond that shall be expressly prohibited. Also prohibited is any circumvention of technical safeguards etc. in order to use such content without authorisation. If the above mentioned prohibitions are violated by any user, you will be liable to VIMN for compensation of all damage resulting therefrom and will indemnify VIMN against all claims of third parties in this regard. \r\n\r\n7.1.5 You are not entitled to any claim against VIMN for content you contributed to be uploaded, published or otherwise used. You alone will be responsible for all uploaded content and VIMN is under no obligation to monitor, control or store content uploaded by users. However, VIMN is entitled and reserves the right to remove and delete uploaded content at its own discretion at any time and without giving reasons without this giving rise to a claim of the user for damages or any other claim of the user. Moreover, VIMN is entitled to bar users permanently or temporarily from continuing to use the UGC Platform without giving reasons and to terminate or restrict users’ access. However, VIMN will terminate your access to the UGC Platform permanently and terminate your Membership without notice only if there is good cause for which VIMN cannot be reasonably expected to continue the user relationship with you. Good cause shall be deemed to exist in particular if you breach the provisions of clause 7.1.6 or clause 7.2.\r\n \r\n7.1.6 You have to ensure yourself that your registration data cannot be used by third parties. In doing so, you are in particular under an obligation not to allow any third parties access to your registration data. Furthermore, you are responsible for ensuring that the content you uploaded to the storage space or otherwise to the UGC Platform is free of viruses, Trojans or other programs that are capable of jeopardising or compromising the continued existence of the Application or of other users’ content. \r\n\r\n7.2 You guarantee (a) that you created all content submitted and uploaded by yourself and at your own cost and/or that you acquired and paid for all rights of use, ancillary copyrights and other rights required under copyright law, (b) that you are therefore the sole holder of the copyrights and rights of use concerned in the content you submitted, (c) that you are entitled to make dispositions over the necessary rights, especially copyrights, title and trademark rights, and (d) that the content and its use does not infringe any rights of third parties. This also includes any personality and name rights of third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned or otherwise included in the content. Before uploading your content, you have to obtain the consent of any third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned in such content. Moreover, you guarantee that the content you upload does not violate any applicable statutory or authority provisions and is not morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, does not glorify violence, does not incite racial hatred and is not insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. The content does not include any incitement to or instruction on how to commit criminal acts. Uploading content which relates to political activities such as, for instance, party meetings, demonstrations or rallies, flyer campaigns or signature collections and reproducing political symbols is also prohibited. Furthermore, no content must be uploaded which insults, defames, harasses or otherwise causes harm to other users. The same applies to users’ comments, ratings and messages. These must also not contain any unauthorised advertising, snowball systems or similar. \r\n\r\n7.2.1 In an event of fault, you will indemnify VIMN and all companies legally affiliated with it against all claims made by third parties to VIMN, alleging that the content you uploaded to the Application infringes their rights or violates any statutory provisions; this includes the reasonable costs of legal defence. For the purposes of legal defence, you will make all necessary documents available to VIMN upon request. \r\n\r\n7.2.2 The guarantees and indemnity claims set out in this clause 7.2 do not expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n7.2.3 If applicable, you will be able to comment and rate the above mentioned content, to take part in votes and to remind about it. In this context, you have the right and the obligation to notify VIMN without undue delay of any content of other users which clearly infringes the provisions of these general terms and conditions and/or any statutory requirements and/or is morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, glorifies violence, incites racial hatred or is insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. \r\n\r\n7.2.4 The user can terminate its Membership without giving reasons at any time. Termination of your membership and deletion of your user data can be initiated by email to support@mtvunderthethumb.com. The right to use the services VIMN offers through the Application and which can be used on the basis of your Membership shall expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n8. Liability and warranty of VIMN \r\n\r\n8.1 VIMN shall be liable in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions (i) for damage arising from injury to life, limb and/or health, (ii) in cases of intent; (iii) in cases of gross negligence, (iv) if VIMN violated the provisions of the German Product Liability Act [Produkthaftungsgesetz - ProdHaftG] or (v) if VIMN gave a guarantee. \r\n\r\n8.2 In cases other than those specified in clause 8.1, VIMN shall be liable for slight negligence only if a “material” contractual obligation was breached. For this purpose, “material” obligations means obligations which are required for the performance of this Agreement, the breach of which puts the achievement of the purpose of the contract at risk and on the fulfilment of which you can, as a rule, rely. In these cases its liability shall be limited to typical and foreseeable damage. \r\n\r\n8.3 The Application shall be transmitted and transferred by third parties; in particular, VIMN itself does not have or operate any transmission networks itself. Consequently, VIMN is neither responsible nor liable for fault-free transmission of the Application. Apart from that, VIMN shall not be liable for any events which fall within the sphere of risk of the operator of the Selling Platform, any third party or yourself; in particular, VIMN shall not be liable for any incompatibility in the event that the operating system of the Compatible Device changes, for the availability of the Application or of individual functionalities of the Application if the operator of the Selling Platform amends its terms of contract and/or technical conditions, for any malfunctions caused by third-party products, for incompatibility with third-party products and for loss of unsecured data. In all of the aforementioned cases, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.4 VIMN shall not be responsible for any loss of a downloaded Application you may cause. VIMN will not be responsible and does not accept liability if you delete the Application (and/or individual elements of the Application) from your Compatible Device or the Application is no longer available on your Compatible Device due to other reasons falling within your sphere of risk or that of any third party. In particular, VIMN shall be under no obligation to make the Application available to you once more or to reimburse you for any user fees already paid (this shall also apply to Subscription Applications). In any such case, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.5 Use of downloaded Applications shall be limited to the Territory. Consequently, VIMN does not accept any liability and/or does not give any warranty in the event that the Application cannot be used outside the Territory.\r\n \r\n9. Users of an MTV Mobile Service \r\n\r\nIf you have an “MTV Mobile”- mobile phone tariff (or any other mobile service offered in cooperation with VIMN or any of its affiliates) of any of our mobile services cooperation partners (e.g. E-Plus in Germany) (hereinafter referred to as “MTV Mobile Service”) and want to use certain premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service, your mobile phone number will be verified with our mobile services cooperation partner. This verification is necessary for us to be able to give you access to the premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service. \r\n\r\n10. Amendments to these terms of contract \r\n\r\nVIMN may amend, modify or supplement these terms of contract from time to time. In this case, VIMN will duly notify you and inform you of the changes. If you do not object to such amended terms of contract within four weeks after you have been notified, the amended terms of use shall be deemed accepted. VIMN undertakes to remind you in the notification of amended terms of contract that the amended terms of contract shall be deemed accepted unless you object to the amendments within four weeks after notification of them. \r\n\r\n11. Governing law \r\n\r\nThis Agreement and all claims arising hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of its conflict of law rules. \r\n\r\n12. Additional terms for users of Compatible Devices by Apple, Inc. \r\n\r\nThe provisions of clause 12 of this Agreement shall apply cumulatively with the provisions of clauses 1 to 11 hereof if you download the Application from the Selling Platform “App Store” which is operated by Apple, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Apple”): \r\n\r\n12.1 Use of the Application shall be governed by the App Store terms of use. \r\n\r\n12.2 You acknowledge that Apple is under no obligation to offer maintenance and/or support services for the Application. \r\n\r\n12.3 If you are entitled to statutory warranty claims, you can notify Apple thereof and can be reimbursed by Apple for any fees already paid. Apple shall not have any other obligations with respect to potential warranty claims. \r\n\r\n12.4 Apple shall not be responsible for any demands or claims you or third parties may bring in connection with the Application or your use of the Application, including, without limitation, for (i) product liability claims, (ii) claims that the Application does not comply with the applicable statutory provisions, (iii) claims under consumer protection or similar laws and (iv) claims of third parties resulting from infringement by the Application of any intellectual property rights of third-parties. \r\n\r\n12.5 You represent and warrant that you are not in a US embargoed country or any country blacklisted by the US Government as sponsor of terrorism and that you are not listed by the US Government on any blacklist that prohibits or restricts business dealings with you. \r\n\r\n12.6 You acknowledge that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and that Apple, based on your acceptance of this Agreement has the right (and has accepted the right) in its capacity as third-party beneficiary to enforce this Agreement against you. \r\n"

All licences granted hereunder will be terminated by such termination and you will no longer be able to use the Application. Any fees already paid are not reimbursable in this case. \r\n\r\n6.4 Apart from that, VIMN is entitled to terminate this Agreement for technical or economic reasons at any time.

If possible, VIMN will make an amount of storage space determined by VIMN available to you for uploading content you created. You have no legal claim to the availability of such storage space. If applicable, you will also be able to comment and rate content of other users and to write messages to other users. \r\n\r\n7.1.1 To be able to upload content to the UGC Platform, you have to properly register within the Application (“Membership”).

You alone will be responsible for all uploaded content and VIMN is under no obligation to monitor, control or store content uploaded by users. However, VIMN is entitled and reserves the right to remove and delete uploaded content at its own discretion at any time and without giving reasons without this giving rise to a claim of the user for damages or any other claim of the user. Moreover, VIMN is entitled to bar users permanently or temporarily from continuing to use the UGC Platform without giving reasons and to terminate or restrict users’ access. However, VIMN will terminate your access to the UGC Platform permanently and terminate your Membership without notice only if there is good cause for which VIMN cannot be reasonably expected to continue the user relationship with you. Good cause shall be deemed to exist in particular if you breach the provisions of clause 7.1.6 or clause 7.2.\r\n \r\n7.1.6 You have to ensure yourself that your registration data cannot be used by third parties. In doing so, you are in particular under an obligation not to allow any third parties access to your registration data.

This also includes any personality and name rights of third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned or otherwise included in the content. Before uploading your content, you have to obtain the consent of any third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned in such content. Moreover, you guarantee that the content you upload does not violate any applicable statutory or authority provisions and is not morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, does not glorify violence, does not incite racial hatred and is not insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. The content does not include any incitement to or instruction on how to commit criminal acts. Uploading content which relates to political activities such as, for instance, party meetings, demonstrations or rallies, flyer campaigns or signature collections and reproducing political symbols is also prohibited. Furthermore, no content must be uploaded which insults, defames, harasses or otherwise causes harm to other users. The same applies to users’ comments, ratings and messages. These must also not contain any unauthorised advertising, snowball systems or similar. \r\n\r\n7.2.1 In an event of fault, you will indemnify VIMN and all companies legally affiliated with it against all claims made by third parties to VIMN, alleging that the content you uploaded to the Application infringes their rights or violates any statutory provisions; this includes the reasonable costs of legal defence. For the purposes of legal defence, you will make all necessary documents available to VIMN upon request. \r\n\r\n7.2.2 The guarantees and indemnity claims set out in this clause 7.2 do not expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n7.2.3 If applicable, you will be able to comment and rate the above mentioned content, to take part in votes and to remind about it. In this context, you have the right and the obligation to notify VIMN without undue delay of any content of other users which clearly infringes the provisions of these general terms and conditions and/or any statutory requirements and/or is morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, glorifies violence, incites racial hatred or is insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. \r\n\r\n7.2.4 The user can terminate its Membership without giving reasons at any time. Termination of your membership and deletion of your user data can be initiated by email to support@mtvunderthethumb.com. The right to use the services VIMN offers through the Application and which can be used on the basis of your Membership shall expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n8. Liability and warranty of VIMN \r\n\r\n8.1 VIMN shall be liable in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions (i) for damage arising from injury to life, limb and/or health, (ii) in cases of intent; (iii) in cases of gross negligence, (iv) if VIMN violated the provisions of the German Product Liability Act [Produkthaftungsgesetz - ProdHaftG] or (v) if VIMN gave a guarantee. \r\n\r\n8.2 In cases other than those specified in clause 8.1, VIMN shall be liable for slight negligence only if a “material” contractual obligation was breached. For this purpose, “material” obligations means obligations which are required for the performance of this Agreement, the breach of which puts the achievement of the purpose of the contract at risk and on the fulfilment of which you can, as a rule, rely. In these cases its liability shall be limited to typical and foreseeable damage. \r\n\r\n8.3 The Application shall be transmitted and transferred by third parties; in particular, VIMN itself does not have or operate any transmission networks itself. Consequently, VIMN is neither responsible nor liable for fault-free transmission of the Application. Apart from that, VIMN shall not be liable for any events which fall within the sphere of risk of the operator of the Selling Platform, any third party or yourself; in particular, VIMN shall not be liable for any incompatibility in the event that the operating system of the Compatible Device changes, for the availability of the Application or of individual functionalities of the Application if the operator of the Selling Platform amends its terms of contract and/or technical conditions, for any malfunctions caused by third-party products, for incompatibility with third-party products and for loss of unsecured data. In all of the aforementioned cases, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.4 VIMN shall not be responsible for any loss of a downloaded Application you may cause. VIMN will not be responsible and does not accept liability if you delete the Application (and/or individual elements of the Application) from your Compatible Device or the Application is no longer available on your Compatible Device due to other reasons falling within your sphere of risk or that of any third party. In particular, VIMN shall be under no obligation to make the Application available to you once more or to reimburse you for any user fees already paid (this shall also apply to Subscription Applications). In any such case, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.5 Use of downloaded Applications shall be limited to the Territory. Consequently, VIMN does not accept any liability and/or does not give any warranty in the event that the Application cannot be used outside the Territory.\r\n \r\n9. Users of an MTV Mobile Service \r\n\r\nIf you have an “MTV Mobile”- mobile phone tariff (or any other mobile service offered in cooperation with VIMN or any of its affiliates) of any of our mobile services cooperation partners (e.g. E-Plus in Germany) (hereinafter referred to as “MTV Mobile Service”) and want to use certain premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service, your mobile phone number will be verified with our mobile services cooperation partner. This verification is necessary for us to be able to give you access to the premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service. \r\n\r\n10. Amendments to these terms of contract \r\n\r\nVIMN may amend, modify or supplement these terms of contract from time to time. In this case, VIMN will duly notify you and inform you of the changes. If you do not object to such amended terms of contract within four weeks after you have been notified, the amended terms of use shall be deemed accepted. VIMN undertakes to remind you in the notification of amended terms of contract that the amended terms of contract shall be deemed accepted unless you object to the amendments within four weeks after notification of them. \r\n\r\n11. Governing law \r\n\r\nThis Agreement and all claims arising hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of its conflict of law rules. \r\n\r\n12.

(hereinafter referred to as “Apple”): \r\n\r\n12.1 Use of the Application shall be governed by the App Store terms of use. \r\n\r\n12.2 You acknowledge that Apple is under no obligation to offer maintenance and/or support services for the Application. \r\n\r\n12.3 If you are entitled to statutory warranty claims, you can notify Apple thereof and can be reimbursed by Apple for any fees already paid. Apple shall not have any other obligations with respect to potential warranty claims. \r\n\r\n12.4 Apple shall not be responsible for any demands or claims you or third parties may bring in connection with the Application or your use of the Application, including, without limitation, for (i) product liability claims, (ii) claims that the Application does not comply with the applicable statutory provisions, (iii) claims under consumer protection or similar laws and (iv) claims of third parties resulting from infringement by the Application of any intellectual property rights of third-parties. \r\n\r\n12.5 You represent and warrant that you are not in a US embargoed country or any country blacklisted by the US Government as sponsor of terrorism and that you are not listed by the US Government on any blacklist that prohibits or restricts business dealings with you. \r\n\r\n12.6 You acknowledge that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and that Apple, based on your acceptance of this Agreement has the right (and has accepted the right) in its capacity as third-party beneficiary to enforce this Agreement against you. \r\n"

This also includes any personality and name rights of third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned or otherwise included in the content. Before uploading your content, you have to obtain the consent of any third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned in such content.

Termination of your membership and deletion of your user data can be initiated by email to support@mtvunderthethumb.com. The right to use the services VIMN offers through the Application and which can be used on the basis of your Membership shall expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n8. Liability and warranty of VIMN \r\n\r\n8.1 VIMN shall be liable in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions (i) for damage arising from injury to life, limb and/or health, (ii) in cases of intent; (iii) in cases of gross negligence, (iv) if VIMN violated the provisions of the German Product Liability Act [Produkthaftungsgesetz - ProdHaftG] or (v) if VIMN gave a guarantee. \r\n\r\n8.2 In cases other than those specified in clause 8.1, VIMN shall be liable for slight negligence only if a “material” contractual obligation was breached.

In all of the aforementioned cases, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.4 VIMN shall not be responsible for any loss of a downloaded Application you may cause. VIMN will not be responsible and does not accept liability if you delete the Application (and/or individual elements of the Application) from your Compatible Device or the Application is no longer available on your Compatible Device due to other reasons falling within your sphere of risk or that of any third party. In particular, VIMN shall be under no obligation to make the Application available to you once more or to reimburse you for any user fees already paid (this shall also apply to Subscription Applications). In any such case, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.5 Use of downloaded Applications shall be limited to the Territory.

Term and termination \r\n\r\n6.1 Except for Subscription Applications, this Agreement is entered into for an indefinite term. In the case of a Subscription Application, this Agreement is entered into for the duration of the applicable subscription period.

You can deactivate this automatic renewal of the subscription period within the time limit set by the operator of the Selling Platform. All licences to the Application (or to the content subscribed to as part of the Application) granted hereunder terminate upon termination of this Agreement. \r\n\r\n6.2 VIMN is under no obligation to continue to offer a Subscription Application beyond the term of your Agreement. \r\n\r\n6.3 VIMN is entitled to terminate this Agreement for good cause without notice at any time. Good cause shall be deemed to exist in particular if you breach the provisions of clause 3 or clause 7.2 of this Agreement or in the event of default on payment. All licences granted hereunder will be terminated by such termination and you will no longer be able to use the Application. Any fees already paid are not reimbursable in this case. \r\n\r\n6.4 Apart from that, VIMN is entitled to terminate this Agreement for technical or economic reasons at any time. In this case, we will give you reasonable advance notice, if possible. All licences granted hereunder will be terminated by such termination and you will no longer be able to use the product. \r\n\r\n6.5 The provisions of clauses 7.2., 8 and 10 hereof shall remain effective in the case of termination of this Agreement for any reason. \r\n\r\n7. Material you submit/User Generated Content (UGC) \r\n\r\n7.1 The Application may include interactive features, including chat features, which enable you to submit content you created (e.g. videos, images or texts) to VIMN and to upload the same to the platform provided for this purpose so as to make it accessible to the public (the “UGC Platform”). If possible, VIMN will make an amount of storage space determined by VIMN available to you for uploading content you created. You have no legal claim to the availability of such storage space. If applicable, you will also be able to comment and rate content of other users and to write messages to other users. \r\n\r\n7.1.1 To be able to upload content to the UGC Platform, you have to properly register within the Application (“Membership”). Upon registration, you promise to make sure that all the information you enter in the fields provided in the registration form is complete and correct. You will be fully liable for all damage resulting from incomplete or incorrect registration. VIMN will be entitled to verify the information you provide by random checks. By getting registered, you agree once more to this Agreement, including to the provisions of this clause 7. \r\n\r\n7.1.2 To be able to register and upload content to the UGC Platform, you must be at least 16 years of age and, if you are younger than 18 years of age, you also need the valid consent of your legal representative. \r\n\r\n7.1.3 Please note that you are allowed to use the UGC Platform only for personal, non-commercial purposes. Consequently, you are not entitled to upload content by which you pursue any commercial interests. \r\n\r\n7.1.4 If VIMN makes any content, including, without limitation, works of music, available to you for creating UGC, use of such content shall expressly be limited to the scope described and permitted in the offer. Any use and reproduction of content made available by VIMN beyond that shall be expressly prohibited. Also prohibited is any circumvention of technical safeguards etc. in order to use such content without authorisation. If the above mentioned prohibitions are violated by any user, you will be liable to VIMN for compensation of all damage resulting therefrom and will indemnify VIMN against all claims of third parties in this regard. \r\n\r\n7.1.5 You are not entitled to any claim against VIMN for content you contributed to be uploaded, published or otherwise used. You alone will be responsible for all uploaded content and VIMN is under no obligation to monitor, control or store content uploaded by users. However, VIMN is entitled and reserves the right to remove and delete uploaded content at its own discretion at any time and without giving reasons without this giving rise to a claim of the user for damages or any other claim of the user. Moreover, VIMN is entitled to bar users permanently or temporarily from continuing to use the UGC Platform without giving reasons and to terminate or restrict users’ access. However, VIMN will terminate your access to the UGC Platform permanently and terminate your Membership without notice only if there is good cause for which VIMN cannot be reasonably expected to continue the user relationship with you. Good cause shall be deemed to exist in particular if you breach the provisions of clause 7.1.6 or clause 7.2.\r\n \r\n7.1.6 You have to ensure yourself that your registration data cannot be used by third parties. In doing so, you are in particular under an obligation not to allow any third parties access to your registration data. Furthermore, you are responsible for ensuring that the content you uploaded to the storage space or otherwise to the UGC Platform is free of viruses, Trojans or other programs that are capable of jeopardising or compromising the continued existence of the Application or of other users’ content. \r\n\r\n7.2 You guarantee (a) that you created all content submitted and uploaded by yourself and at your own cost and/or that you acquired and paid for all rights of use, ancillary copyrights and other rights required under copyright law, (b) that you are therefore the sole holder of the copyrights and rights of use concerned in the content you submitted, (c) that you are entitled to make dispositions over the necessary rights, especially copyrights, title and trademark rights, and (d) that the content and its use does not infringe any rights of third parties. This also includes any personality and name rights of third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned or otherwise included in the content. Before uploading your content, you have to obtain the consent of any third parties whose image may be reproduced or who may be mentioned in such content. Moreover, you guarantee that the content you upload does not violate any applicable statutory or authority provisions and is not morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, does not glorify violence, does not incite racial hatred and is not insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. The content does not include any incitement to or instruction on how to commit criminal acts. Uploading content which relates to political activities such as, for instance, party meetings, demonstrations or rallies, flyer campaigns or signature collections and reproducing political symbols is also prohibited. Furthermore, no content must be uploaded which insults, defames, harasses or otherwise causes harm to other users. The same applies to users’ comments, ratings and messages. These must also not contain any unauthorised advertising, snowball systems or similar. \r\n\r\n7.2.1 In an event of fault, you will indemnify VIMN and all companies legally affiliated with it against all claims made by third parties to VIMN, alleging that the content you uploaded to the Application infringes their rights or violates any statutory provisions; this includes the reasonable costs of legal defence. For the purposes of legal defence, you will make all necessary documents available to VIMN upon request. \r\n\r\n7.2.2 The guarantees and indemnity claims set out in this clause 7.2 do not expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n7.2.3 If applicable, you will be able to comment and rate the above mentioned content, to take part in votes and to remind about it. In this context, you have the right and the obligation to notify VIMN without undue delay of any content of other users which clearly infringes the provisions of these general terms and conditions and/or any statutory requirements and/or is morally harmful for adolescents or of a pornographic or racist nature, glorifies violence, incites racial hatred or is insulting or otherwise contrary to good morals. \r\n\r\n7.2.4 The user can terminate its Membership without giving reasons at any time. Termination of your membership and deletion of your user data can be initiated by email to support@mtvunderthethumb.com. The right to use the services VIMN offers through the Application and which can be used on the basis of your Membership shall expire upon termination of your Membership. \r\n\r\n8. Liability and warranty of VIMN \r\n\r\n8.1 VIMN shall be liable in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions (i) for damage arising from injury to life, limb and/or health, (ii) in cases of intent; (iii) in cases of gross negligence, (iv) if VIMN violated the provisions of the German Product Liability Act [Produkthaftungsgesetz - ProdHaftG] or (v) if VIMN gave a guarantee. \r\n\r\n8.2 In cases other than those specified in clause 8.1, VIMN shall be liable for slight negligence only if a “material” contractual obligation was breached. For this purpose, “material” obligations means obligations which are required for the performance of this Agreement, the breach of which puts the achievement of the purpose of the contract at risk and on the fulfilment of which you can, as a rule, rely. In these cases its liability shall be limited to typical and foreseeable damage. \r\n\r\n8.3 The Application shall be transmitted and transferred by third parties; in particular, VIMN itself does not have or operate any transmission networks itself. Consequently, VIMN is neither responsible nor liable for fault-free transmission of the Application. Apart from that, VIMN shall not be liable for any events which fall within the sphere of risk of the operator of the Selling Platform, any third party or yourself; in particular, VIMN shall not be liable for any incompatibility in the event that the operating system of the Compatible Device changes, for the availability of the Application or of individual functionalities of the Application if the operator of the Selling Platform amends its terms of contract and/or technical conditions, for any malfunctions caused by third-party products, for incompatibility with third-party products and for loss of unsecured data. In all of the aforementioned cases, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.4 VIMN shall not be responsible for any loss of a downloaded Application you may cause. VIMN will not be responsible and does not accept liability if you delete the Application (and/or individual elements of the Application) from your Compatible Device or the Application is no longer available on your Compatible Device due to other reasons falling within your sphere of risk or that of any third party. In particular, VIMN shall be under no obligation to make the Application available to you once more or to reimburse you for any user fees already paid (this shall also apply to Subscription Applications). In any such case, warranty shall be excluded as well. \r\n\r\n8.5 Use of downloaded Applications shall be limited to the Territory. Consequently, VIMN does not accept any liability and/or does not give any warranty in the event that the Application cannot be used outside the Territory.\r\n \r\n9. Users of an MTV Mobile Service \r\n\r\nIf you have an “MTV Mobile”- mobile phone tariff (or any other mobile service offered in cooperation with VIMN or any of its affiliates) of any of our mobile services cooperation partners (e.g. E-Plus in Germany) (hereinafter referred to as “MTV Mobile Service”) and want to use certain premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service, your mobile phone number will be verified with our mobile services cooperation partner. This verification is necessary for us to be able to give you access to the premium services reserved to users of an MTV Mobile Service. \r\n\r\n10. Amendments to these terms of contract \r\n\r\nVIMN may amend, modify or supplement these terms of contract from time to time. In this case, VIMN will duly notify you and inform you of the changes. If you do not object to such amended terms of contract within four weeks after you have been notified, the amended terms of use shall be deemed accepted. VIMN undertakes to remind you in the notification of amended terms of contract that the amended terms of contract shall be deemed accepted unless you object to the amendments within four weeks after notification of them. \r\n\r\n11. Governing law \r\n\r\nThis Agreement and all claims arising hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of its conflict of law rules. \r\n\r\n12. Additional terms for users of Compatible Devices by Apple, Inc. \r\n\r\nThe provisions of clause 12 of this Agreement shall apply cumulatively with the provisions of clauses 1 to 11 hereof if you download the Application from the Selling Platform “App Store” which is operated by Apple, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Apple”): \r\n\r\n12.1 Use of the Application shall be governed by the App Store terms of use. \r\n\r\n12.2 You acknowledge that Apple is under no obligation to offer maintenance and/or support services for the Application. \r\n\r\n12.3 If you are entitled to statutory warranty claims, you can notify Apple thereof and can be reimbursed by Apple for any fees already paid. Apple shall not have any other obligations with respect to potential warranty claims. \r\n\r\n12.4 Apple shall not be responsible for any demands or claims you or third parties may bring in connection with the Application or your use of the Application, including, without limitation, for (i) product liability claims, (ii) claims that the Application does not comply with the applicable statutory provisions, (iii) claims under consumer protection or similar laws and (iv) claims of third parties resulting from infringement by the Application of any intellectual property rights of third-parties. \r\n\r\n12.5 You represent and warrant that you are not in a US embargoed country or any country blacklisted by the US Government as sponsor of terrorism and that you are not listed by the US Government on any blacklist that prohibits or restricts business dealings with you. \r\n\r\n12.6 You acknowledge that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and that Apple, based on your acceptance of this Agreement has the right (and has accepted the right) in its capacity as third-party beneficiary to enforce this Agreement against you. \r\n"

Once the transformation is complete, the formerly Plain Jane will surprise her unsuspecting crush with the new look and reveal her true feelings. Acquired from The CW Network, Plain Jane is a makeover show with the added twist of a potential love match after the transformation. "
