  context

    $context

    a 
      b
        c

    a'
      b





    --what kind of information do i need to store in b and c to be able to link back to a'?

      in b we can store $context a
        we need path to infer where something comes from
          path has to be cached i geuss... (more mem unfortunately) if its used in inferring instance information

          paths also need to have extra info to store what if something is instance or something else
